<p>Leche Flan is a dessert made-up of eggs and milk with a soft caramel on top. It resembles cr√®me caramel and caramel custard. This delicious dessert is known throughout the world.It has been a regular item in the  menu of most restaurants because of its taste, ease in preparation and long shelf life. It can also be added as a component to build other great tasting dessert 
creations.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul type='disc'> 
<li>10 pieces eggs
<li>1 can condensed milk (14 oz)
<li>1 cup fresh milk or evaporated milk
<li>1 cup granulated sugar
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<ol>
<li>Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used).
<li>Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater
<li>Add eggs, cooking oil, and vanilla extract. Mix well.
<li>Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly
<li>Pour-in the fresh milk and Vanilla. Mix well
<li>Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire
<li>Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.
<li>Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold
<li>Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold
<li>Cover the top of the mold using an Aluminum foil
<li>Steam the mold with egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.
<li>After steaming, let the temperature cool down then refrigerate
<li>Serve for dessert. Share and Enjoy!
