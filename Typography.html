<br>
*instrumental*</b><br>
<br>
[1st Stanza]
<br>
<i>Going back to the corner where I first saw you<br>
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, I'm not gonna move<br>
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand<br>
Saying, "If you see this girl, can you tell her where I am?"<br>
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand<br>
I'm not broke, I'm just a broken-hearted man<br>
I know it makes no sense, what else can I do?<br>
And how can I move on when I'm still in love with you?<br></i>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
<u>'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me<br>
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be<br>
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet<br>
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street<br>
So I'm not moving<br>
I'm not moving<br></u>
<br>
[2nd Stanza]
<br>
<strike>Policeman says, "Son, you can't stay here"<br>
I say, "There's someone I'm waiting for<br>
If it's a day, a month, a year"<br>
Gotta stand my ground, even if it rains or snows<br>
If she changes her mind, this is the first place she will go<br></strike>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
<u>'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me<br>
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be<br>
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet<br>
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street<br>
So I'm not moving<br>
I'm not moving<br></u>
<br>
[Bridge]
<br>
<em>People talk about the guy who's waiting on a girl, oh<br>
There are no holes in his shoes, but a big hole in his world, mmm<br>
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved<br>
And maybe you won't mean to, but you'll see me on the news<br>
And you'll come running to the corner 'cause you know it's just for you<br>
I'm the man who can't be moved<br>
I'm the man who can't be moved</em><br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
<strong>'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me<br>
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be<br>
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet<br>
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street<br>
So I'm not moving<br>
I'm not moving</strong><br>
<br>
[Chorus]
<br>
<strong>'Cause if one day you wake up, and find that you're missing me (I'm not moving)<br>
And your heart starts to wonder where on this Earth I could be (I'm not moving)<br>
Thinking maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet (I'm not moving)<br>
And you'll see me waiting for you, on the corner of the street</strong><br>
<br>
[Outro]
<br>
<sup>Going back to the corner<br>
Where I first saw you<br>
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag<br>
I'm not gonna move</sup><br>
